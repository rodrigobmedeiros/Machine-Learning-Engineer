So, to really impact the world with our projects, we have to follow some steps:\n",

    "Develop a program, put your code on production require a lot of work, actually, a lot of team work. Usually more than one person work togheter into a project. Because of this it's very important for code to be clean and modular. A good clean code must be simple, readable and consise and modular code consists in divide the general problem into small pieces like functions and modules. With this, we'll can reuse, write less code to solve the problems and make a more readable and collaborative code.\n",

    "Sometimes, we don't know exactly how to built a better structure of our code to solve the problem and it's normal to solve the problem but not with the best practices considering software engineering. Because of this, eventually, we refactoring the code, what means, restructuring code to improve internal structure without changing external functionality.\n",
