We have to think that one day these applications will be on production and we have to think about how to develop a good program. So, to really impact the world with our projects, we have to follow some steps:\n",

    "Develop a program, put your code on production require a lot of work, actually, a lot of team work. Usually more than one person work togheter into a project. Because of this it's very important for code to be clean and modular. A good clean code must be simple, readable and consise and modular code consists in divide the general problem into small pieces like functions and modules. With this, we'll can reuse, write less code to solve the problems and make a more readable and collaborative code.\n",

    "Sometimes, we don't know exactly how to built a better structure of our code to solve the problem and it's normal to solve the problem but not with the best practices considering software engineering. Because of this, eventually, we refactoring the code, what means, restructuring code to improve internal structure without changing external functionality.\n",

    "In many machine learning models there are some parameters that need to be specified by the model creator and which can't be determined directly from the data itself. Generally the approach to finding the best parameters is to train a bunch of models with different parameters and then choose the model that works best.\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker provides an automated way of doing this. In fact, SageMaker also does this in an intelligent way using Bayesian optimization. What we will do is specify ranges for our hyperparameters. Then, SageMaker will explore different choices within those ranges, increasing the performance of our model over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we define a model, we set a specific parameters (hyperparameters), in this case instead of choose a certain value for each one, we'll define a range of values, sageMaker will train the model a lot of times finding the best model with the best hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can follow all these calculations using the log on CloudWatch. To access that just follow the steps:\n",

    "1) Get the name of training jog  \n",
